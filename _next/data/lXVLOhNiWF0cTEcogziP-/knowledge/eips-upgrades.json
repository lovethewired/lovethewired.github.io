What is the difference?\n\nERC20 and ERC721 define the fungible token and non-fungible token standard. They are designed as smart contract standards that define interfaces and specifications of virtual tokens that can be traded.\nBoth token standards allow approvals to other accounts and contracts for handling token balances. This enables composable automated markets to exist.\n\n# What are some important upgrades to the network?\n\n| Name | Date| Notes |\n| :- | :- | :- |\n| Frontier | Jul 2015 | \"thawing\" period for early adopters |\n| Frontier Thawing | Sep 2015 | lift of 5k gas limit per block |\n| | | allowed for transactions (min. 21k) |\n|  |  | difficulty bomb set to enable PoS |\n| Homestead | Mar 2016 | |\n| DAO Fork | Jul 2016 | response to DAO hack to make users whole |\n| | | Ethereum Classic remains |\n| Tangerine Whistle | Oct 2016 | response to DoS attacks due to underpriced opcodes |\n| Spurious Dragon | Oct 2016 | state trie clearing |\n| | | EIP 155 Replay attack protection (introduces chainid) |\n| | | introduces contract size limit (24k bytes) |\n| Byzantinum | Oct 2017 | adds staticcall, revert, ECC functionalities |\n| Constantinople | Feb 2019 | ability to interact with addresses that haven't been created yet |\n| Istanbul | Dec 2019 | |\n| Muir Glacier | Jan 2020 | |\n| Beacon Chain genesis | Dec 2020 | |\n| Berlin | Apr 2021 | Optional Access lists |\n| Altair | Oct 2021 | Beacon chain upgrade |\n| Arrow Glacier | Dec 2021 | |\n| Gray Glacier | Jun 2022 | |\n| Bellatrix | Sep 2022 | Beacon chain upgrade |\n| Paris (Merge) | Sep 2022 | Switch to PoS |\n\n**Difficulty Bomb:**\n- difficulty increases every 100k blocks\n- was pushed back with almost every major hard fork\n","title":"EIPS & Upgrades","excerpt":"Historical EIPS & Upgrades","date":"Invalid Date"}},"__N_SSG":true}
